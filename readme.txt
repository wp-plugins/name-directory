This plugin provides a name directory (glossary) with configurable layout options. It can be embedded with a simple shortcode. You can have multiple directories.

== Description ==

This plugin adds name/term directories to your Wordpress installation. They are like glossaries. The output on your website is like a glossary/index. I recommend you to take a look at the screenshots, they illustrate more that words.

The Name Directory plugin was orginally developed for ParkietenVilla.nl to show a directory of names to name your budgies.

A name directory is a directory that contains entries with the following properties:

 - name
 - description
 - submitter

Every directory can be embedded with a very simple shortcode which you can past in your own pages and posts. Every directory has a few configuration options that customize the layout and functionality of the directory: 

 - Show/Hide title
 - Show/Hide description
 - Show/Hide suggestion form
 - Show/Hide submitter name
 - Show/Hide a horizontal rule between the entries

The administration view of this plugin has the familiar look and feel of (the rest of) the Wordpress Administration panel. I have done my best to enable some AJAX-features in the administration panel, so you can work efficiently while adding new entries.

== Installation ==

Installation is very easy. You can just download this plugin through the Plugin Finder in your Wordpress Administration Panel.

If you download the zip-file, it's also very easy: 

1. Unzip the file which results into a directory called `name-directory`
1. Upload that directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create a new name directory and
1. Copy the shortcode and paste it into a post or page to show it on your website
