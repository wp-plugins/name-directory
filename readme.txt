Name directory (glossary) with lots of options. Very easy to add to your site with a simple shortcode. It can have multiple directories.

== Description ==

This plugin adds name/term directories to your WordPress installation. They are like glossaries. The output on your website is like a glossary/index. I recommend you to take a look at the screenshots, they illustrate more than words.

The Name Directory plugin was orginally developed for ParkietenVilla.nl to show a directory of names to name your budgies.

A name directory is a directory that contains entries with the following properties:

 - name
 - description
 - submitter

You can create multiple directories with this plugin. Every directory can be embedded with a very simple shortcode which you can just copy-and-paste in your own pages and posts. Every directory has a few configuration options that customize the layout and functionality of the directory: 

 - Show/Hide title
 - Show/Hide description
 - Show/Hide suggestion form
 - Show/Hide submitter name
 - Show/Hide search function
 - Show/Hide a horizontal rule between the entries
 - Show/Hide all entries when the user has not chosen an index-letter yet
 - When you embed a directory, you can configure it to start with a letter of your choosing. E.g.: start on letter J.

The administration view of this plugin has the familiar look and feel of (the rest of) the WordPress Administration panel. I have done my best to enable some AJAX-features in the administration panel, so you can work efficiently while adding new entries.

== Installation ==

= Displaying a directory on your site =

1. Go to the Name Directory settings page
1. Hover over the directory you want to add to the page.
1. A few options should show now, like Delete, Manage and Shortcode (see screenshot https://ps.w.org/name-directory/assets/screenshot-2.png).
1. Click 'Shortcode', a little textbox will show now.
1. Copy-and-paste the content of the textbox into the page you want the plugin to show up.
1. Save and view the page to see the result.

= Installing the plugin =
Installation is very easy. You can just download this plugin through the Plugin Finder in your WordPress Administration Panel.

If you download the zip-file, installation isn't that difficult either:

1. Unzip the file which results into a directory called `name-directory`
1. Upload that directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create a new name directory and add some names
1. Copy the shortcode and paste it into a post or page to show it on your website


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does the shortcode look like? =

The shortcode for this Name Directory plugin is like this:
`[namedirectory dir="1"]`

The `1` in this example is the internal ID of the directory, the rest of the shortcode should always look like this.

1. Go to the Name Directory settings page
1. Hover over the directory you want to add to the page.

= Can you install this plugin or directory for me? =

Maybe, send me an email to see if we can work this out.

= Is there a bulk-add or import in this plugin? =

Since v1.7, yes there is! You can import a .csv-file into a directory.

1. Go to the Name Directory settings page
1. Hover over the directory you want to add to the page.
1. A few options should show now, like Delete, Manage and Import - see screenshot for a settings-example https://ps.w.org/name-directory/assets/screenshot-2.png
1. Click 'Import'
1. Select your .csv-file
1. Upload

You can add names, descriptions and submitter entries, just the first column (name) is required. Good to know: the first row is always ignored (they should be headers).
You can download an example file at http://ps.w.org/name-directory/assets/name-directory-import-example.csv
If you need any help, contact me on the forums.

= Can I make the text bigger or another color? =

Yes you can, with CSS. If you know your way around CSS you might already know that you can style elements by their class name or HTML structure.
This plugin was written with styling / CSS in mind. Using the HTML inspector of your favourite browser you should be able to discover the classnames, but here are a few popular classes:

* `.name_directory_index`: Index links (the letters A-Z)
* `.name_directory_name_box > strong`: Name / Entry title
* `.name_directory_name_box > div`: Name / Entry descriptiong
* `.name_directory_total`: Total count of names / entries
* `.name_directory_index > form`: Search form
* `#name-directory-search-input-box`: Search input box
* `#name-directory-search-input-button`: Search button
* `.name_directory_submit_bottom_link`: Link to submit form

= How can I contact you? =

You can through this plugin information page or in the Support forums.
